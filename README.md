# MiXiMaX: MiXplorer HTTP File Server Redesigned
A redesign of the HTTP File Server on MiXplorer.


## Features
* A complete rework of how the server looks across different devices.
* Responsive design so it always fits the display.
* New Header and Sidebar Nav.
* Breadcrumb directory buttons in the Header.
* Dark Mode and Light Mode, and a simple toggle to switch between the two.
* Automatic detection of user device (Mobile/PC) using user agent.
* Toggle to change platform (Mobile/PC) in the Sidebar.
* Option to choose default media player based on platform (Mobile/PC).
    * **PC:** PotPlayer, VLC Player.
    * **Mobile:** VLC Player, XPlayer, MX Player, MX Player Pro.
* Built-in image viewer and Facebook-style image navigation (Previous/Next).
* New File Upload design and animation in the Sidebar.
* New Footer with a Scroll to Top button.


## Dark Mode and Light Mode
While you can switch between the two through the sidebar, you can still set a default mode in advance by changing the port number.
* Port number ends in ODD digit > Light mode.
    * *For example,* 8181 would default to Light mode.
* Port number ends in EVEN digit > Dark mode.
    * *For example,* 8182 would default to Dark mode.


## Releases
Releasing mods of MiXplorer is prohibited by its original developer, so I will not do that.
But you are welcome to use the files in this repo to make one for yourself.
